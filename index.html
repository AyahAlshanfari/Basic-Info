    <h1>Oman</h1>
    <p>Oman is a country occupying the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula at the confluence of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea.</p>
    <p>The capital city of Oman is Muscat.It lies along the northern coast. Blending modern and traditional architecture, the city commands a view of the Gulf of Oman and serves as a port and commercial centre.</p>
    <p>Significant modernization did not begin until after the coup in 1970 that brought Qaboos bin Said (Qābūs ibn Saʿīd) to power, at which point Oman rapidly began to develop an advanced economy. The once insular country now actively encourages tourism, and travelers come from afar to enjoy its hospitality and unspoiled landscapes.</p>
    <p>The climate is hot and dry in the interior and hot and humid along the coast</p>
    <p>Summer temperatures in the capital of Muscat and other coastal locations often climb to 110 °F (43 °C), with high humidity; winters are mild, with lows averaging about 63 °F (17 °C).</p>
    <p>Dhofar is dominated by the summer monsoon, making Ṣalālah’s climate more temperate than that of northern Oman. Rainfall throughout the country is minimal, averaging only about 4 inches (100 mm) per year, although precipitation in the mountains is heavier.</p>
    <p>More than half of Oman’s population is Arab.</p>
    <p>Arabic is the official language, and Modern Standard Arabic is taught in schools.</p>
    <p> The jibālīs, for example, speak older dialects of South Arabic. These differ greatly from most other dialects, which are derived from North Arabic (as is Modern Standard Arabic).</p>
    <p>The overwhelming majority of Omanis are Muslims. </p>
    <p>The Central Bank of Oman is the country’s main monetary and banking regulatory body. Founded in 1974, it issues and regulates the national currency, the Omani rial, manages the government’s accounts, and acts as lender of last resort. The country has commercial and development banks, and a number of foreign banks operate there. A stock exchange, the Muscat Securities Market, was opened in 1988.</p>
    <p>The national flag of Oman (Arabic: علم عُمان‎) consists of three stripes (white, green and red) with a red bar on the left that contains the national emblem of Oman (Dagger and two swords). </p>
    <p>Oman is famous for fresh, sea air of breathing. Muscat is famous for dazzling souks and superb sea food do not miss the famous Omani sweets known as Omani Halva. Gum or Omani bread is not easily found outside Oman. But Oman terrain brings the biggest thrills.</p>
    <p>Men generally wearing an ankle length collarless gown called a dishdasha and women a long black dress called an abaya.</p>
    <p>In Oman, the roads are always clean. Not only because rules are strictly applied, and the cleaners do their jobs, but also because the Omanis love their country so much that they also keep it clean and pretty.</p>
    <p>The hottest day of the year is May 23, with an average high of 101°F and low of 87°F. The cool season lasts for 3.1 months, from December 2 to March 5, with an average daily high temperature below 81°F. The coldest day of the year is January 13, with an average low of 64°F and high of 76°F.</p>
    <p>Oman is a relatively safe country and serious crime is rare. The Royal Oman Police is notably efficient and honest. Driving in Muscat can sometimes be a problem, although this is due more to congestion than bad driving on the part of the locals.</p>
    <p>Chips Oman is a potato chip snack that is famous for its red and blue plastic bags with an image of a kitchen knife slicing through a peeled potato. It is one of the 25 food products sold by Oman's Al Jufair Food Industries, which proudly proclaims the chips as the premiere product of the industry.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, a visit to Oman doesn't come cheap. The major expenses are accommodation and transport/tours. The very cheapest hotel rooms start at around 12–15 OR per night (£20–25/US$30–40), at least double this for mid-range places, and anything from 75 OR (£120/$200) and upwards for top-end places.</p>
    <p>Oman Observer reports on the recent and rare snowfall in the Sultanate! Snowfall has been reported from places like Jabel Shams in Al Hamra and Jabal al Sarat in Ibri.</p>
